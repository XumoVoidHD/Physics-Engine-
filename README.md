# ⚛️ Electron Interaction Simulator

This is a simple 2D physics-based simulation built using **Pygame** that visualizes the interactions between charged particles (like electrons and protons) using **Coulomb's Law**. It simulates how particles with like and unlike charges attract or repel each other in real time.

## 🧪 Features

- Realistic simulation using Coulomb's Law.
- Supports multiple particles with custom masses and charges.
- Color-coded particles for easy tracking.
- Wall collision with configurable damping.
- On-screen debugging info (position, velocity, charge).
- Dynamic visualization of particle movements.
